          <br><span class="wiser">Smooth implementation and transition</span>
          <br>
          <br>We needed to ensure the transition process was as smooth as possible whilst having the minimal resource impact on the client’s internal team. With that in mind, an auto-enrolment process was implemented to provide a streamlined solution in transferring members into the new plan without the need for individual consent.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>Our client was further supported throughout the transition with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a dedicated Transition Manager who provided complete oversight of the process&nbsp;</li>
          <li>ongoing access to an executive sponsor</li>
          <li>a robust framework to manage out-of-market risk</li>
          <li>a bespoke communication plan to help employees to understand changes</li>
          <li>regular updates all stakeholders involved</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-paragraph"><span class="bolder"></span><span class="wiser"></span>By drawing on the knowledge of these experts, we were able to create a robust implementation plan that pre-empted likely issues, further negating risk for our client.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="wiser">Increased efficiency.</span>
          <br>
          <br>The removal of governance burdens helped our client to manage DC risks and regulation in relation to the changing landscape. Additionally, the Lifelens platform allowed for the streamlining of many of our client’s administration processes; delivering its benefits package in an improved and efficient way through highly integrated payroll and HR processes.
          <br>
          <br><span class="wiser">Better value for members </span>
          <br>
          <br>Our client wanted to ensure that their new scheme not only delivered benefits to their business, but also delivered better value to its members. To achieve high-level of engagement, we developed a customised engagement kit to support employees in understanding their new pension values and benefits. This included face to face workshops, online education and tutorials as well as a single sign-on to view and make changes to their pension dashboards easily.</p>

As one of the largest and most respected players in the industry, a challenge they faced was of supporting diverse and geographically dispersed employees. This created issues of investing in their people amongst the uncertainty of potential acquisitions; all contribution to a &nbsp;highly complicated employee strategy.
          <br>
          <br>The need for a single, future proofed and versatile solution became apparent in order for them to continue looking after their talent.
          <br>
          <br><span class="wiser">Motivation for change<br><br></span>Operating under an unbundled pension scheme was creating further frustration, especially due to the large costs associated with the many pension scheme external suppliers as well as the administrative burden. &nbsp;Our client was looking for a solution to help the business achieve greater efficiencies, streamline administration and reduce governance burden around their pensions offering. The decision to move to a bundled solution was identified as means of addressing these issues without compromising on value.
          <br>
          <br><span class="bolder">Creating a bespoke solution&nbsp;</span>
          <br>
          <br>We worked together with our client to create a bespoke solution tailored to their needs precisely. We understand that every business has a unique set of priorities and circumstances. As such, close collaboration from a place of understanding was of high importance to the success of this solution.&nbsp;Through this process, Master Trust was identified as the best option for both their active and deferred members. This provided a modern default investment solution designed to maximise returns for the risk that employees are willing to take, as well as access to GSIPP and D2C ISA for a wider range of self-investment and savings options for their people.</p>
