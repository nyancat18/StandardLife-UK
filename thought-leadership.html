        <br>
        <br>The UK Regulators recently set a task for the Independent Governance Committees (IGCs) of UK DC pension providers to assess how well providers are delivering ‘Value for Money’ (VfM) for members.
        <br>
        <br>A number of IGCs - with the support of their UK workplace pension providers and including Standard Life - conducted research to develop a common understanding of what members value when assessing value for money.
        <br>
        <br>This proved to be a challenging question, not only because of the product complexity, but also because of the lack of comparability and employees understanding in choosing their own pension providers.
        <br>
        <br>The research study was coordinated by Sacker &amp; Partners LLP (Sackers); containing two phases which comprised of a series of workshops and focus groups as well as an online survey containing more than 15,000 member responses.
        <br>
        <br>*Key findings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bolder">Good value for money is associated with good outcome at retirement. </span>This is underpinned by the total amount of contributions going in as well as the quality of pension provision and member experience&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Employees are highly concerned about the financial security</span> of their pension and consequently ‘Controls &amp; safeguards’ and ‘reputable financially strong pension provider’ are both in the top 4 attributes&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">‘Charges’ are not front of mind</span> and are not in the top 10 attributes, the overall pensions experience being more important&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Overall Satisfaction and VfM scores average at 6.2 and 6.4 respectively</span>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Education is highly influential in helping members understand how a good outcome at retirement can be achieved</span>; once this is understood members place more emphasis on support / engagement.Improved perception of VfM by employees may be achieved through more effective delivery of the key attribute however, the challenge is employee engagement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content-paragraph"><span class="bolder"></span><span class="wiser"></span>The research reveals the significant gaps in knowledge and misconceptions around workplace pensions. These are often responsible for discouraging members from paying in larger contributions.
        <br>
        <br>The research results also highlighted a great opportunity for employers to increase employee engagement if they bring more clarity and direction &nbsp;to their employees in helping them to better understand and remove their misconceptions.
        <br>
        <br>However, improving the overall value for money perception requires ongoing education and segmented communication.
