        <br>Choose from active or passive growth options. Our investments solutions offers different of levels of risk and a variety of glidepath destinations - from annuitisation to drawdown - to suit the needs of your scheme members.
        <br>
        <br>All our default investment options are built around the same key design components.
        <br>
        <br>Our default investment option - the Active Plus III Universal Strategic Lifestyle Profile - is developed with those needs, attitudes and behaviours in mind. This solution has been designed to generate the highest possible returns for each unit of risk taken, giving our members the opportunity to meet both their desire for consistency and long term returns generation.If you believe that most of your members will use their pension savings in a particular way, our investment solutions allow you to tailor your approach and select a profile with a glidepath destination to match.
        <br>
        <br>For any other specific investment requirements, we’re happy to discuss these too.
        <br>
        <br><span class="bolder">Ongoing choice and flexibility</span>
        <br>
        <br>Post pension freedom allows members to have more flexibility in how they use their pension savings. As such, a scheme default is now less likely to be able to perfectly meet the needs of all members, meaning choice is more important than ever before.
        <br>
        <br>Simply providing investment choices that members don’t understand is unlikely to help.
        <br>
        <br>That being said, our solutions offer a range of options designed to help members get what they want from their pension savings.
        <br>
        <br>Members who want to tailor their investments can do so in a way that suits them. Whether that’s choosing a risk level that suits them better, choosing a glidepath destination that suits how they intend to use their pension savings, or building and managing a portfolio themselves from our range of individual fund options.
