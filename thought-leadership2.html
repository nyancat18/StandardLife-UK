        <p>The Employee View of ‘Value for&nbsp;Money’ in Workplace Pensions’&nbsp;The UK Regulator has set as task for the Independent Governance Committees (IGCs) of UK DC pension&nbsp;providers to assess how well providers are delivering ‘Value for Money’ (VfM) for members.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>A number&nbsp;of IGCs, with the support of their UK workplace pension&nbsp;providers, including Standard Life, conducted&nbsp;a&nbsp;research to develop a common understanding of what members see as important when assessing value for money&nbsp;and why.&nbsp;</p><a class="link tlearderhead" href="thoughtleadership/value-for-money.html">Read More &gt;&gt;</a>

        <p>If you started from scratch, you’d design a retirement savings system that was practical, fair and future-proofed.&nbsp;You’d only need to review it, rather than constantly rethink it.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>But we’re not starting from scratch and there is a legacy of complicated elements to our pensions infrastructure that&nbsp;have led to constant change in recent years. Some ideas are well thought-through design changes to the system&nbsp;whereas others are necessitated by events elsewhere in the worlds of politics and economics.&nbsp;</p><a class="link tlearderhead" href="thoughtleadership/compliance.html">Read More &gt;&gt;</a>
