        <h4>‘The Employee View of ‘Value for&nbsp;Money’ in Workplace Pensions’</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;The UK Regulator has set as task for the Independent Governance Committees (IGCs) of UK DC pension&nbsp;providers to assess how well providers are delivering ‘Value for Money’ (VfM) for members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A number of IGCs, with the support of their UK workplace pension&nbsp;providers, including Standard Life, conducted a research to develop a common understanding of what members see as important when assessing value for money&nbsp;and why.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This proved to be a challenging question, not only because of the product complexity, but also because of the lack of comparability and the fact that employees don’t choose themselves their pension provider.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The research study was coordinated by Sacker&amp; Partners LLP (Sackers) and contained two phases which comprised, a series of workshops with all-day focus groups of nearly 50 members which included discussions before and after targeted education, and an online survey containing more than 15,000 member responses. *&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Key findings:&nbsp;<br></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Good value for money is associated with good outcome at retirement, underpinned by the total amount of contributions going in, the quality of pension provision and member experience&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Employees are highly concerned about the financial security of&nbsp;their pension and consequently ‘Controls &amp; safeguards’ and ‘reputable financially strong pension provider’ are both in the top 4 attributes&nbsp;</li>
          <li>‘Charges’ are not front of mind and are not in the top 10 attributes, the overall pensions experience being more important&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Overall Satisfaction and VfM scores average at 6.2 and 6.4 respectively&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Education is highly influential in helping members&nbsp;understand how a good outcome at retirement can be achieved; once this is understood members place more emphasis on support and engagement&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Matching employer contributions and tax relief rated highly once understood&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Improved&nbsp;perception of VfM by employees may be achieved through more effective delivery of the key attribute however, the challenge is employee engagement.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The research revealed that there are significant gaps in knowledge and misconceptions around workplace pensions. These are often responsible for discouraging members from paying in larger contributions. The research results also highlighted the fact that here is a great opportunity for employers to increase employee engagement if they bring more clarity by helping their employees better understand their options and if misconceptions are reduced or removed. But improving the overall value for money perception, requires ongoing education and segmented communication.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you wish to speak to us about driving better employee engagement, our team will be happy to assist you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>*The research was conducted in the autumn of 2016.&nbsp;</p>
