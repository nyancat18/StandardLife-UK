        <h2>Thought Leadership&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Jamie Jenkins, Head of Pensions Strategy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>30th March 2017</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h4>‘‘The journey from Compliance to Engagement’’</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you started from scratch, you’d design a retirement savings system that was practical, fair and future-proofed. You’d only need to review it, rather than constantly rethink it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But we’re not starting from scratch and there is a legacy of complicated elements to our pensions infrastructure that have led to constant change in recent years. Some ideas are well thought-through design changes to the system whereas others are necessitated by events elsewhere in the worlds of politics and economics.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In truth, the big ticket&nbsp;items are the simplification of the State Pension, the decline of&nbsp;Defined Benefit, the rise of&nbsp;Defined Contribution through automatic enrolment, and the income flexibility now offered at retirement. You could reasonably add tax incentives to that list and of course the increasingly role of technology.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Taking each of those in turn, the direction of travel is pretty clear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The State Pension is now simpler, and there to provide a basic standard of living. It’s communication, the transition&nbsp;from old to new, the rate at which it’s uprated and the age at which it is paid will continue to be debated, but the&nbsp;basic premise is simple; pay 35 years worth of National Insurance Contributions and you will receive around £8,000 a year at some point later in life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Defined Benefit pensions are in terminal decline, with more now closed than open, both in terms of new members and accrual for existing members. The recent Green Paper is not designed to reinvigorate DB; it was written to help&nbsp;facilitate an orderly run-off, balancing the interests of members with the need to maintain solvency for the employer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The new way of providing pensions is through widespread workplace DC coverage. 7.5m people have been enrolled, making it one of the most successful policy interventions in recent times. Opt out rates remain low at&nbsp;around 10%, and even a double of trebling of this in the final year would leave it well below earlier predictions.</p>
        <p>From 55, people can access their DC pensions (including, of course, any transferred from DB) any way they wish. Despite the headlines of billions of pounds being extracted in the first couple of years, and the larger than expected&nbsp;tax-take from Treasury, experience suggests most withdrawals are sensible; usually people taking either small pots or tax-free cash only.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Contrary to predictions of a societal spending spree on sports cars, forecourts appear to be as they were.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Beyond that, most of the changes we now see are relatively minor – albeit they can be very irksome. Mention the reduced Money Purchase Annual Allowance, the Tapered Annual Allowance, or even just the Annual Allowance, and you’ll hear about the complications these bring to people’s saving ambitions and the administration headaches for employers.</p>
        <p>However, the agenda seems to have shifted from one of never ending structural change to one that seems to be building on the major policy planks now in place. Between the DB Green Paper, the Pension Schemes Bill, the Pension Regulator’s focus on standards of trusteeship and the Financial Conduct Authority’s drive for efficiency and transparency, a clear theme emerges; consolidation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Put simply, the number of remaining open DB schemes is reducing, the number of Master Trusts offered for auto enrolment is likely to reduce and the number of individual trust-based schemes has already come down from&nbsp;around 45,000 to less than 35,000 in around 5 years.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, despite the pension proliferation caused by five years of auto enrolment, we’ll probably come through the other side with fewer – but bigger – solutions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Charges are lowering, contributions are increasing, governance is strengthening and investment solutions are&nbsp;modernising. All of this is happening now without the need for further policy intervention, beyond what is already in&nbsp;tow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Add to that a government now somewhat engaged in the nation’s departure from Europe, and even the bandwidth for changes to pensions seems somewhat limited anyway.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tax relief will continue to attract attention as a significant expense for government, but the groundwork for a review&nbsp;has already been done and many would argue it’s only a question of time before it is simplified, at the same time hopefully removing many of the existing allowance restrictions.</p>
        <p>The Pensions Dashboard marks a leap forward with technology. Viewing your pension and making changes online&nbsp;is nothing new and most providers offer decent functionality in this area, but viewing everything together in one&nbsp;place – including State Pensions – is something different altogether. It opens up huge opportunity for innovation&nbsp;and, ultimately, member engagement. A 22 year old auto enrollee may not be immediately enthused at the prospect of retirement, but they may be interested in managing a pot of wealth. Time will tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps we are genuinely moving into a phase of stability.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The DWP’s auto enrolment review is in keeping with this. It seeks to build upon the success of the existing policy and whether its coverage should be extended and contributions increased.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most notably, perhaps, the review also poses questions around member engagement. Perhaps we are genuinely moving from a period where the focus was purely on compliance with pensions, to one where we recognise the&nbsp;need to get people interested. This isn’t simply for their own purposes in taking control, but to ensure that employers see some return on their pensions spending.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maybe we even start moving to a position where people learn the reference points for what a good pension scheme&nbsp;looks like. Most large employers are already paying above the 2019 minimum 3% contribution, yet how many&nbsp;employees recognise that and value it. In time, 3% will be compliance, nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This could be a turning point for pensions if we can move from a position of compliance to one of engagement. Perhaps we can even harbour some optimism that today’s young workers will retire - not only with savings - but with knowledge and confidence.&nbsp;</p>
